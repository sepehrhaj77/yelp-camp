# yelp-camp
Website designed to function similar to Yelp, but for camp sites. Provides interactive map to locate camping locations. Upon submitting a new campsite location, can upload multiple images and provide a location which will be added to the map. Implements user account authorizations so that a campground can not be created or edited without signing in.
